            <h3>A Tribute to Kobe & Gianna</h3>
            <p>“Mamba, you were taken away from us too soon,” O’Neal said. “Your next chapter of life was just beginning. But now it is time for us to continue your legacy. You said yourself that everything negative — pressure, challenges — is all an opportunity for me to rise. So we now take that sage advice to now rise from anguish and begin with the healing. Just know that we have got your back, little brother. I'll look after things down here. I’ll be sure to teach Natalia, Bianca, and baby Capri all your moves. And I promise I will not teach them my free throw techniques.”</p>
        <p>With tears streaming down his face, Michael Jordan revealed that he and Kobe Bryant were closer friends than anyone realized.“Everyone wanted to talk about the comparisons between him and I,” Jordan said. “I just wanted to talk about Kobe.”<br>
        Jordan, 57, said he took “great pride” in the relationship they built and said he “wanted to be the best big brother I could be.”The six-time N.B.A. champion then poked fun at himself for his emotional state. Anticipating the social media reaction to his face, Jordan said: “Now he’s got me — I’ll have to look at another crying meme for the next …” before the crowd’s laughter intervened.<br>
        
            “When Kobe Bryant died, a piece of me died,” Jordan said.</p>
